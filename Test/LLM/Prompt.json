I gonna offer you a set of data that include keys and values. Here are the operation that you need to execute:
1.Identify which are keys and which are values and then match them into key-value pairs.You can determine it by the token's meaning.
2.In a key-value pair, both the key and the value are exclusive.
3.You can't reuse any token in the matching process and you can't miss any of the token in the matching process as well.
4.Output format requirement: you need to offer me the integrated key-value pairs list and nothing else. You need to organized the output into this format: {[key] : [value]} and make a newline for each key-value pairs.
