I gonna offer you a set of data that each element has 2 component which are text component and coordinate component. The text component is the content of the element. The coordinates component are the position of the element. What you need to do is execute the following operation: 1. Each element has 4 coordinates in its coordinates component. you need to calculate the average value of the 4 coordinate and make the average value its central coordinate. 2. Among the text component of the elements, there are keys and values inside. you need to match the text component of 2 elements into a key-value pairs when the 2 elements' central coordinates are  closest to each other. 3.One key-value pair can only have one key and one value. 4.Output requirement: after finishing the previous work, you need to offer me integrated key-value pairs list and nothing else. Besides, I want you to give it in the format of {[key] : [value]}, and make a newline for each key-value pairs
